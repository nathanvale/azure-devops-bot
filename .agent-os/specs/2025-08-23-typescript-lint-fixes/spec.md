# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: TypeScript and ESLint Error Fixes
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix all 123 TypeScript compilation errors and ESLint violations in the Azure DevOps Bot codebase to achieve production-ready code quality. This comprehensive cleanup will ensure type safety, eliminate runtime errors, and maintain code consistency across the project.

## User Stories

### Developer Code Quality Experience

As a developer maintaining the Azure DevOps Bot, I want to have zero TypeScript compilation errors and ESLint violations, so that I can confidently deploy code without type-related runtime issues and maintain consistent code quality standards.

**Workflow**: Developer runs `pnpm build` or `pnpm lint` → All checks pass without errors → Code can be safely deployed → TypeScript provides accurate intellisense and catches errors at compile time → Team maintains high code quality standards.

### Production Deployment Readiness

As a team lead, I want the codebase to compile cleanly and pass all linting checks, so that automated CI/CD pipelines can successfully build and deploy the application without manual intervention.

**Workflow**: Code is committed → CI/CD pipeline runs → TypeScript compilation succeeds → ESLint passes → Tests run successfully → Deployment proceeds automatically.

## Spec Scope

1. **Missing Database Methods** - Add getWorkItemById, getWorkItemsByIds, and getWorkItemsByIteration methods to DatabaseService
2. **TypeScript Type Safety** - Replace all 100+ instances of `any` type with proper TypeScript types
3. **Import Path Resolution** - Fix @/ alias configuration issues in test files and vitest workspace
4. **Global Type Definitions** - Add proper type declarations for NodeJS, URL, and test globals
5. **Unused Variable Cleanup** - Remove or properly prefix unused variables per ESLint rules

## Out of Scope

- Adding new functionality or features
- Changing existing business logic or behavior
- Performance optimizations beyond type safety
- Refactoring file structure or architecture

## Expected Deliverable

1. Zero TypeScript compilation errors when running `pnpm build` or `pnpm type-check`
2. Zero ESLint violations when running `pnpm lint`
3. All existing tests continue to pass with proper type definitions
