# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-23-database-testing-cleanup/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-23
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Post-Removal Unit Tests**

- Verify all remaining test files execute without database mock dependencies
- Test business logic components that don't require database interaction
- Validate authentication and utility functions work independently

**Configuration Tests**

- Verify Vitest configuration excludes deleted test files correctly
- Test that build process completes without missing import errors
- Validate package.json scripts execute properly

### Integration Tests

**File Removal Verification**

- Confirm all specified mock files are completely removed
- Verify no orphaned imports or references remain in codebase
- Test that project builds and starts without deleted dependencies

**Documentation Validation**

- Verify documentation accurately reflects new testing approach
- Test that migration guidelines are clear and actionable
- Validate future implementation path is technically sound

### Regression Tests

**Build System Integrity**

- Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds after file removal
- Verify ESLint passes without unused import warnings
- Test that all package.json scripts execute successfully

**Remaining Test Suite**

- Confirm all non-database tests continue to pass
- Verify test utilities still function for non-database scenarios
- Test that Vitest configurations work correctly

## Test Strategy

### Verification Approach

1. **Pre-removal Snapshot**: Document current test coverage and passing tests
2. **Incremental Removal**: Remove files one at a time, testing build after each
3. **Reference Cleanup**: Systematically find and remove all mock references
4. **Final Validation**: Comprehensive test suite run to ensure stability

### Quality Gates

- Zero failing tests after cleanup (excluding intentionally removed tests)
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- No ESLint warnings related to missing imports
- All package.json scripts execute without errors

### Future Test Readiness

- Vitest configuration prepared for in-memory SQLite
- Test setup patterns documented for future database tests
- Clear separation between unit tests and future integration tests

## Mocking Requirements

**No Database Mocking**

- Completely eliminate Prisma client mocking
- Remove MSW database-related handlers (keep Azure DevOps API mocking for integration tests)
- Eliminate complex mock setup and teardown infrastructure

**Retain Non-Database Mocking**

- Keep Azure DevOps API mocking for external service integration tests
- Maintain utility function mocking where appropriate
- Preserve time/date mocking for deterministic tests

**Future Mocking Strategy**

- Use real in-memory SQLite instead of mocking database operations
- Mock only external services and APIs, not internal database layer
- Prefer dependency injection over mocking for testability
