# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Merge Readiness Fixes
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Address all critical issues, test failures, and architectural inconsistencies identified in the comprehensive code review to prepare the branch for merging to main. This spec ensures the codebase is stable, properly tested, and aligned with our architectural decisions.

## User Stories

### Developer Confidence

As a developer, I want all tests passing and dependencies properly managed, so that I can confidently deploy the application without runtime failures.

When running the test suite, I expect to see all 348 tests passing without any failures or warnings. The application should build and run successfully on a fresh checkout with all dependencies properly locked and resolved.

### Clean Architecture Alignment

As a tech lead, I want the codebase to follow our architectural decisions consistently, so that the code is maintainable and aligns with our documented strategy.

The implementation should strictly follow decision DEC-004 which mandates removal of all NLP/semantic search code. The codebase should be focused solely on data mirroring and structured JSON output for AI agent consumption.

### Production Readiness

As a product owner, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and perform efficiently, so that users have a reliable experience with sub-100ms query times.

The application should recover from transient failures, handle Azure CLI timeouts gracefully, and complete full project sync in under 5 minutes for typical workloads.

## Spec Scope

1. **Test Suite Repairs** - Fix all 13 failing unit tests, particularly resilience policy assertions
2. **Dependency Management** - Add pnpm-lock.yaml and ensure reproducible builds
3. **Database Initialization** - Properly initialize SQLite database with migrations on fresh install
4. **Architecture Alignment** - Remove all NLP/semantic search code per decision DEC-004
5. **Performance Optimization** - Implement batch database operations and parallel processing
6. **Error Handling** - Add comprehensive error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
7. **Schema Completion** - Align Prisma schema with TypeScript interfaces for all fields

## Out of Scope

- New features beyond fixing existing issues
- UI/UX changes or visual enhancements
- Additional Azure DevOps integrations
- PM2 setup and configuration (separate spec)
- Authentication changes
- Multi-project support

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 348 unit tests passing consistently
2. Clean git status with proper dependency lock files
3. Database initializes correctly on fresh install
4. No NLP/semantic search code remains in codebase
5. Batch operations reduce sync time by 50%
6. Zero unhandled promise rejections or uncaught exceptions
