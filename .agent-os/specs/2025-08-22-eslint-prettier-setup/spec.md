# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: ESLint and Prettier Setup
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement ESLint v9 flat config and Prettier formatting to align azure-devops-bot with the code quality standards established in the @orchestr8 monorepo. This will ensure consistent code formatting, automatic import sorting, and type-safe development practices across the codebase.

## User Stories

### Developer Code Quality

As a developer, I want automatic code formatting and linting, so that I can focus on writing logic rather than formatting code and maintain consistency with the @orchestr8 codebase.

When I save a file in VS Code, the code should automatically format according to the Prettier rules (no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas). When I run the lint command, imports should be automatically sorted using perfectionist, and TypeScript issues should be caught early. This workflow ensures that all code follows the same standards without manual intervention.

### Team Collaboration

As a team lead, I want enforced code standards across the project, so that code reviews focus on logic and architecture rather than style issues.

Every commit should have consistent formatting, sorted imports, and pass TypeScript strict checks. The CI pipeline can validate that all code meets these standards before merging, reducing back-and-forth in pull requests about code style.

## Spec Scope

1. **ESLint v9 Configuration** - Implement flat config with TypeScript, perfectionist, and prettier integration
2. **Prettier Configuration** - Set up no-semicolon, single-quote formatting matching @orchestr8
3. **VS Code Integration** - Configure auto-format on save and ESLint auto-fix
4. **NPM Scripts** - Add lint, format, and check commands for CI/CD integration
5. **Code Migration** - Transform existing codebase to match new formatting standards

## Out of Scope

- Adding new TypeScript strict mode rules beyond what @orchestr8 uses
- Implementing pre-commit hooks or husky
- Setting up GitHub Actions for automated checking
- Adding additional linting plugins beyond perfectionist

## Expected Deliverable

1. All TypeScript files formatted with Prettier (no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas)
2. All imports sorted according to perfectionist rules (type imports first, then built-ins, externals, internals)
3. VS Code automatically formats and fixes linting issues on save
4. `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` commands work correctly
5. All existing tests continue to pass after formatting changes
