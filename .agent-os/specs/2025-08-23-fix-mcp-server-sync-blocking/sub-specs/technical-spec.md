# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-23-fix-mcp-server-sync-blocking/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-23
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Non-blocking server startup**: MCP server must respond to stdio protocol within 5 seconds
- **Immediate data access**: All MCP tools must query SQLite database directly without waiting for sync
- **Background sync isolation**: Detailed sync operations must not block the main MCP event loop
- **Error resilience**: Server continues functioning when Azure DevOps API calls fail
- **Performance preservation**: Maintain sub-100ms response times for cached data queries

## Approach Options

**Option A: Remove Initial Sync Check**
- Remove the `shouldSync()` check and initial `performSyncDetailed()` call from server startup
- Let background sync handle all refresh operations
- Pros: Simple, immediate startup, no blocking
- Cons: Data might be stale until first background sync completes

**Option B: Conditional Initial Sync** (Selected)
- Add startup flag to skip initial sync when data already exists
- Check if database has recent data (< 1 hour old) and skip detailed sync
- Only perform initial sync if database is empty or very stale
- Pros: Balances data freshness with startup speed, preserves existing behavior when needed
- Cons: Adds complexity to startup logic

**Option C: Async Initial Sync**
- Start MCP server immediately, then run initial sync asynchronously
- Use Promise-based background task that doesn't block stdio processing
- Pros: Server available immediately, sync happens in parallel
- Cons: More complex async handling, potential race conditions

**Rationale**: Option B provides the best balance - it preserves the existing sync behavior for truly stale data while fixing the blocking issue for the common case where recent data exists.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. The solution uses existing infrastructure:
- **Existing**: Prisma ORM for database queries
- **Existing**: Azure CLI integration for sync operations  
- **Existing**: MCP protocol handling for stdio communication
