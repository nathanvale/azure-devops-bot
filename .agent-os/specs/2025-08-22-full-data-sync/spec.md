# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Full Data Sync
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace the current limited field sync with comprehensive metadata fetching using `az boards work-item show --expand all` to capture every Azure DevOps field and ensure complete data mirroring in the local SQLite database.

## User Stories

### Complete Data Access

As a development team lead, I want access to ALL work item fields (not just basic ones), so that I can generate comprehensive reports with sprint information, effort tracking, relationships, and detailed metadata.

**Detailed Workflow**: When the sync service runs, it should fetch every available field from Azure DevOps including custom fields, relationships, board columns, iteration paths, effort data, all date fields, and complete user information. This ensures that any report or query I need can be satisfied from local data without missing fields.

### Historical Data Preservation

As a product manager, I want complete Azure DevOps responses stored locally, so that even if we don't initially map a field to our database schema, the data is still available for future use.

**Detailed Workflow**: Each work item fetch should store both the structured fields we currently use AND the complete JSON response from Azure DevOps. This creates a safety net ensuring no data loss and allows future schema evolution without data re-sync.

## Spec Scope

1. **Comprehensive Field Extraction** - Fetch all available fields using `az boards work-item show --expand all`
2. **Raw JSON Storage** - Store complete Azure DevOps JSON response alongside structured fields
3. **Schema Enhancement** - Extend database schema to capture critical missing fields
4. **Batch Processing** - Implement parallel fetching for improved sync performance
5. **Error Handling** - Robust handling of Azure CLI failures and partial data scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Work item comments (separate Phase 1 feature)
- Work item relationships parsing (Phase 3 feature)  
- State history tracking (Phase 3 feature)
- Custom field type detection (Phase 3 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Work items sync with 100% field coverage including iteration paths, effort data, board columns, and all date fields
2. Complete Azure DevOps JSON responses stored in database for data completeness guarantee
3. Sync performance improved through parallel processing with configurable concurrency
