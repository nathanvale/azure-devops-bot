# Environment Variable Management Specification

> Spec: Environment Variable Management for Azure DevOps Bot
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The Azure DevOps Bot requires a robust, secure, and type-safe environment variable management system to handle configuration across different environments, with a specific focus on Personal Access Token (PAT) security and MCP server integration.

Current challenges include:

- Insecure direct `process.env` usage
- Lack of type safety and validation
- No clear strategy for environment-specific configurations
- Potential security risks with PAT storage

Our solution will implement a comprehensive environment variable management approach that ensures security, type safety, and flexibility.

## User Stories

### Developer Persona: Security-Conscious Developer

As a developer working on the Azure DevOps Bot, I want a type-safe and validated configuration system so that I can:

- Easily configure the application across different environments
- Prevent misconfiguration through strong typing
- Securely manage sensitive credentials like Azure DevOps PAT
- Understand configuration requirements at runtime

### Operations Persona: DevOps Engineer

As a DevOps engineer managing the Azure DevOps Bot deployment, I want a flexible configuration system that allows me to:

- Configure the application through environment variables
- Validate configuration before application startup
- Manage different configurations for development, testing, and production
- Integrate seamlessly with PM2 process management

## Spec Scope

1. **Type-Safe Configuration**
   - Implement `envalid` for environment variable validation
   - Create a centralized configuration module
   - Ensure compile-time and runtime type safety

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Validate and sanitize Personal Access Token (PAT)
   - Implement secure storage strategies
   - Add runtime checks for required credentials

3. **Multi-Environment Support**
   - Define configuration schemas for dev/test/prod
   - Support `.env` file loading
   - Enable easy environment switching

4. **MCP Integration**
   - Design configuration pass-through for MCP server registration
   - Ensure env vars can be securely transmitted during initialization

5. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear, actionable error messages
   - Implement graceful startup failures for misconfiguration
   - Log configuration issues securely

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of existing configuration
- Implementation of a secrets management system beyond environment variables
- Advanced encryption of stored credentials
- Support for cloud-based secret management platforms
- Modifications to existing MCP protocol beyond env var passing

## Expected Deliverable

1. A type-safe `config.ts` module with:
   - Validated environment variables
   - Clear typing for all configuration options
   - Secure PAT handling
   - Environment-specific configurations

2. Updated documentation detailing:
   - Configuration requirements
   - How to set up environment variables
   - Security best practices for PAT management

3. Comprehensive test suite covering:
   - Configuration validation
   - Error handling
   - Environment switching
   - PAT security checks

4. PM2 ecosystem configuration template supporting different environments

5. Migration guide for existing users to adopt the new configuration system
