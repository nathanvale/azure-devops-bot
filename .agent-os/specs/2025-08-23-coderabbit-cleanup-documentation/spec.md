# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: CodeRabbit Cleanup Documentation
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Systematically address all 75 CodeRabbit actionable comments from the Azure DevOps REST API migration PR, focusing on removing legacy Azure CLI references and updating documentation to reflect the new PAT-authenticated REST API architecture. This cleanup ensures production readiness and maintains accurate technical documentation aligned with the implemented REST client package.

## User Stories

### Documentation Consistency

As a development team member, I want all project documentation to accurately reflect the REST API architecture, so that new developers can understand the current implementation without confusion from outdated Azure CLI references.

**Workflow**: Developer reads project documentation → understands PAT authentication flow → follows REST API patterns → successfully integrates with existing azure-devops-client package.

### Production Deployment Readiness

As a system administrator, I want to ensure all service files use the REST API client instead of Azure CLI dependencies, so that the application can be deployed in production environments without CLI tool requirements.

**Workflow**: Deploy to production → environment has PAT configured → services use REST client → no Azure CLI dependency failures → application runs successfully.

### Codebase Maintenance

As a maintainer, I want systematic cleanup of technical debt identified by automated code review, so that the codebase remains maintainable and aligned with architectural decisions.

**Workflow**: CodeRabbit identifies inconsistencies → systematic prioritization and cleanup → technical debt reduced → maintenance burden decreased.

## Spec Scope

1. **P0 Service Code Cleanup** - Remove Azure CLI subprocess calls from core service files and replace with REST API client usage
2. **P0 Security Documentation** - Update security section to reflect PAT authentication and HTTPS communication patterns
3. **P1 Architecture Documentation** - Update tech stack documentation from CLI to REST API integration descriptions
4. **P1 Service Layer Integration** - Wire REST client into remaining service modules that still reference CLI commands
5. **P2 Project Documentation** - Update high-level project documentation and performance analysis to reflect REST API approach

## Out of Scope

- Creating new functionality beyond the existing REST API client
- Major architectural changes to the azure-devops-client package
- Performance optimization beyond documentation updates
- Test suite expansion beyond fixing references to removed CLI dependencies

## Expected Deliverable

1. **All P0 blocking issues resolved** - Service files successfully use REST API client, security documentation accurate
2. **Documentation consistency achieved** - All references updated from Azure CLI to REST API with PAT authentication
3. **Codebase clean and maintainable** - No technical debt from CodeRabbit analysis remaining, ready for production deployment
