# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Comprehensive Schema

## Overview

Expand the database schema to capture ALL Azure DevOps work item fields, ensuring no data is lost and the system becomes a complete mirror of Azure DevOps work item information.

## User Stories

### Complete Data Capture

As a developer using the MCP server, I want access to every field from Azure DevOps work items, so that I never encounter missing information when generating reports or analyzing work items.

The current schema captures the most common fields, but Azure DevOps work items contain dozens of additional fields like custom fields, attachment information, work item types specific fields, and more. Users need complete access to enable comprehensive reporting and analysis.

### Future-Proof Schema

As a system administrator, I want the database to automatically capture new Azure DevOps fields, so that schema changes don't break the system when Microsoft adds new functionality.

Azure DevOps evolves regularly with new fields and metadata. The system should be resilient to these changes and capture new information automatically.

## Spec Scope

1. **Field Discovery** - Analyze `az boards work-item show --expand all` output to identify all possible fields
2. **Schema Extension** - Add comprehensive field coverage to WorkItem model with proper types
3. **Migration Strategy** - Create database migration that preserves existing data while adding new fields
4. **Data Mapping** - Update sync service to populate all new schema fields from Azure DevOps data
5. **Raw JSON Preservation** - Ensure complete Azure DevOps response is still stored in rawJson field as backup

## Out of Scope

- Custom field type validation (store as strings/JSON for flexibility)
- Historical data migration for fields not previously captured
- Performance optimization of new fields (will be addressed in Phase 2)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete Schema Coverage** - WorkItem model includes every field available from Azure DevOps API
2. **Successful Migration** - Database migration completes without data loss
3. **Full Data Sync** - Sync service populates all fields from `--expand all` Azure DevOps responses
