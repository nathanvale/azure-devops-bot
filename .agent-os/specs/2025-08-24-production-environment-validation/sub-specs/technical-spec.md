# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-production-environment-validation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Real Azure DevOps Integration**: Use actual PAT authentication against fwcdev organization and Customer Services Platform project
- **Production Data Volume**: Test with 1,056+ work items representing current production workload
- **Performance Validation**: Sync times ≤ 30 seconds, query responses ≤ 100ms consistently under load
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: All 8 MCP tools must return valid JSON responses with real data
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of network issues, authentication failures, and rate limiting scenarios
- **Data Integrity**: 100% accuracy between local SQLite data and Azure DevOps web interface
- **Process Management**: PM2 service must handle crashes, memory leaks, and automatic restarts gracefully

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Manual Production Testing
- Pros: Simple setup, direct observation of results
- Cons: Time-intensive, not repeatable, prone to human error

**Option B:** Automated Production Testing Suite (Selected)
- Pros: Repeatable, comprehensive coverage, measurable results, can be run multiple times
- Cons: More initial development work, requires test infrastructure

**Rationale:** Automated testing ensures consistent validation across all requirements and provides measurable benchmarks for performance criteria. Given the critical nature of production deployment, comprehensive automated validation is essential.

## External Dependencies

- **Azure DevOps Production Access**: Valid PAT token with work items (read & write) permissions for fwcdev organization
- **PM2 Process Manager**: Globally installed PM2 for production service management testing
- **Production Environment**: Actual production machine setup matching deployment requirements

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. Configure production PAT authentication with proper Azure DevOps permissions
2. Set up PM2 ecosystem configuration for production-like service management
3. Create validation test suite with performance measurement capabilities

### Phase 2: Integration Validation  
1. Test authentication and initial connection to production Azure DevOps
2. Validate all 8 MCP tools with real work item data from Customer Services Platform
3. Measure and verify sync performance meets ≤ 30 second requirement

### Phase 3: Reliability Testing
1. Test error scenarios: network failures, authentication issues, rate limiting
2. Validate PM2 crash recovery and automatic restart functionality  
3. Perform extended load testing to identify memory leaks or performance degradation

### Phase 4: Data Integrity Validation
1. Compare local SQLite data against Azure DevOps web interface for accuracy
2. Verify all work item fields, comments, and metadata are correctly synchronized
3. Test edge cases: special characters, large descriptions, complex work item relationships
