## Overview

Validate the Azure DevOps Bot REST API migration in a production environment with real Azure DevOps data to ensure bulletproof reliability, performance, and data integrity before final deployment.

## User Stories

### Production Validation Testing

As a Development Team Lead, I want to verify that the Azure DevOps Bot works flawlessly with real production Azure DevOps data, so that I can confidently deploy the REST API migration and depend on sub-100ms query performance for daily work item reporting.

This involves comprehensive testing against the actual "Customer Services Platform" project with 1,056+ work items, validating all 8 MCP tools under production load, and confirming that authentication, sync performance, error handling, and data integrity all meet production requirements.

### Deployment Readiness Validation

As a Product Owner, I want to ensure the always-on PM2 service can handle production workloads and recover from failures, so that the Azure DevOps Bot provides 24/7 availability without manual intervention.

This includes testing PM2 process management, crash recovery scenarios, memory usage under load, and confirming the service can maintain sub-100ms query times with complete work item data synchronization.

## Spec Scope

1. **Real Azure DevOps Integration Testing** - Validate PAT authentication and API access against production Azure DevOps organization
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Confirm sync times ≤ 30 seconds for 1,056+ work items and query responses ≤ 100ms
3. **MCP Protocol Validation** - Test all 8 MCP tools with real data to ensure proper JSON responses and error handling  
4. **Data Integrity Verification** - Compare local SQLite data against Azure DevOps web interface for accuracy
5. **Always-On Service Testing** - Validate PM2 process management, auto-restart, and crash recovery scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Performance optimization beyond current implementation
- New feature development or MCP tool additions
- Schema changes or database migrations
- Multi-organization or multi-project support

## Expected Deliverable

1. Production environment successfully validates all 8 MCP tools with real Azure DevOps data
2. Sync performance consistently meets ≤ 30 second target for complete project data
3. Query performance maintains ≤ 100ms response times under production load
