# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Migrate from Azure CLI to Azure DevOps REST API
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace the unreliable Azure CLI-based integration with a direct Azure DevOps REST API client, implemented as a fully abstracted package that can be easily extracted into its own repository for reuse across multiple projects.

## User Stories

### Performance & Reliability

As a developer using the Azure DevOps Bot, I want work item syncing to complete in under 30 seconds instead of 3-5 minutes, so that I can get updated data quickly without waiting for lengthy sync processes that often fail due to rate limiting.

**Detailed Workflow**: When the MCP server starts or performs a background sync, it should use batch REST API calls to fetch 1,056 work items in ~20 requests (200 items per batch) instead of spawning 1,056 individual Azure CLI subprocesses, resulting in 30x faster performance and elimination of circuit breaker failures.

### Abstracted Package Design

As a platform architect, I want the Azure DevOps REST API integration to be completely abstracted into its own package, so that I can later extract it into a separate repository and reuse it across multiple projects without coupling to this specific codebase.

**Detailed Workflow**: The Azure DevOps REST API functionality should be implemented in `src/packages/azure-devops-client/` with clean interfaces, its own package.json, comprehensive TypeScript types, and zero dependencies on the parent project's specific domain logic, enabling easy extraction and reuse.

### Pluggable Integration

As a system integrator, I want to swap data providers without changing business logic, so that the system remains flexible and can adapt to different Azure DevOps organizations or even alternative work item systems.

**Detailed Workflow**: The current `AzureDevOpsClient` interface should remain unchanged, but the implementation should delegate to the abstracted REST API package through clean adapter patterns, allowing future swapping of implementations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Abstracted Azure DevOps REST API Package** - Self-contained package in `src/packages/azure-devops-client/`
2. **Batch Operations Implementation** - Work item batch fetching, comment batch operations, efficient WIQL queries
3. **Clean Interface Design** - Repository-ready package with no coupling to parent project
4. **Rate Limiting & Resilience** - Intelligent throttling using REST API headers and proper retry strategies  
5. **Complete CLI Replacement** - Remove all Azure CLI dependencies and subprocess overhead
6. **Performance Optimization** - Achieve 30x performance improvement through batch operations

## Out of Scope

- Gradual migration or feature flags (clean replacement)
- Maintaining backward compatibility with CLI approach
- Complex authentication beyond Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Webhook implementations (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Self-contained package** in `src/packages/azure-devops-client/` ready for extraction
2. **30x performance improvement** - sync times from 3-5 minutes to 10-30 seconds  
3. **Zero Azure CLI dependencies** - complete removal of subprocess-based calls
4. **Pluggable architecture** - clean interfaces allowing future provider swapping
5. **Production-ready reliability** - proper rate limiting, retry logic, and error handling
