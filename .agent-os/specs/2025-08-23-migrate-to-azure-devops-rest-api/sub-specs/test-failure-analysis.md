# Test Failure Analysis

This is the comprehensive analysis of test failures for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-23-migrate-to-azure-devops-rest-api/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-23
> Version: 1.0.0
> Status: Critical Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Test Execution Results:**

- **Total Tests**: 338
- **Passing**: 202 (59.8%)
- **Failing**: 114 (33.7%)
- **Skipped**: 22 (6.5%)
- **Errors**: 30 runtime errors
- **Overall Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE RATE**

**Critical Finding:** The high failure rate (33.7%) is entirely due to the test suite not being migrated from Azure CLI mocking patterns to REST API mocking patterns during the implementation phase.

## Failure Root Cause Distribution

### 1. Missing Environment Variable (80% of failures)

**Error Pattern:** `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT environment variable is required`

**Affected Test Files:**

- `src/services/__tests__/azure-devops.test.ts`: 45 failures
- `src/services/__tests__/azure-devops-rest-integration.test.ts`: 16 failures
- `tests/integration/azure-devops-server.test.ts`: 25 failures
- `src/services/__tests__/field-discovery.test.ts`: 8 failures

**Technical Cause:**
The new `AzureDevOpsClient` constructor validates the `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` environment variable on instantiation, but test environments don't have this variable set.

```typescript
// Failing pattern in tests
const client = new AzureDevOpsClient() // ❌ Throws immediately

// Required fix
beforeEach(() => {
  process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT = 'test-token'
  // ... rest of setup
})
```

### 2. Mock Strategy Mismatch (15% of failures)

**Error Pattern:** Mocks not intercepting actual HTTP calls

**Technical Cause:**
Tests mock `child_process.exec` for CLI commands, but the new implementation uses HTTP client calls that bypass these mocks entirely.

```typescript
// Old working pattern (CLI)
mockExecAsync.mockResolvedValue({
  stdout: JSON.stringify(workItemData),
})

// Current failing pattern - HTTP calls not intercepted
// Tests pass but with empty/undefined results

// Required new pattern (REST)
mockProvider.queryWorkItems.mockResolvedValue(workItemData)
```

**Affected Areas:**

- Work item fetching operations
- Comment retrieval functions
- Batch operation testing
- Performance timing tests

### 3. Import Path Issues (5% of failures)

**Error Pattern:** Module resolution and type definition errors

**Technical Cause:**
The new package structure exports types differently than expected by test files.

```typescript
// Problematic imports
import { WorkItemData } from '../packages/azure-devops-client/dist/index.js'
// May not resolve correctly in test environment

// Type conflicts
interface WorkItemData // Conflicting definitions
```

## Detailed Test File Analysis

### High Priority Files (Production Blocking)

#### src/services/**tests**/azure-devops.test.ts

- **Total Tests**: 45
- **Failing**: 45 (100% failure rate)
- **Primary Issue**: Environment variable + mock mismatch
- **Impact**: Core client functionality untested

**Specific Failures:**

```
✗ should fetch and parse work items successfully
✗ should handle work items without assigned user
✗ should handle work items with null assigned user
✗ should use correct WIQL query
✗ should handle Azure CLI command errors
✗ should fetch work item comments
✗ should handle empty comment responses
```

**Fix Requirements:**

1. Set `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` in test setup
2. Mock `AzureDevOpsProvider` methods instead of `exec`
3. Update assertion patterns for REST responses

#### src/services/**tests**/azure-devops-rest-integration.test.ts

- **Total Tests**: 16
- **Failing**: 16 (100% failure rate)
- **Primary Issue**: Provider initialization failing
- **Impact**: Integration layer completely untested

**Specific Failures:**

```
✗ should maintain backward compatibility for fetchWorkItems
✗ should maintain backward compatibility for fetchSingleWorkItem
✗ should correctly transform REST provider data
✗ should handle missing fields gracefully
✗ should leverage batch operations for multiple work items
```

**Fix Requirements:**

1. Mock provider initialization success
2. Set up MSW handlers for REST endpoints
3. Validate data transformation accuracy

#### tests/integration/azure-devops-server.test.ts

- **Total Tests**: 25
- **Failing**: 25 (100% failure rate)
- **Primary Issue**: MCP server integration with REST client
- **Impact**: End-to-end functionality completely untested

### Medium Priority Files

#### src/services/**tests**/field-discovery.test.ts

- **Total Tests**: 8
- **Failing**: 6 (75% failure rate)
- **Primary Issue**: CLI command mocking no longer applicable
- **Impact**: Field discovery features partially broken

**Working Tests**: Tests that don't instantiate AzureDevOpsClient
**Failing Tests**: Tests that use client for field discovery

#### src/services/**tests**/batch-performance.test.ts

- **Total Tests**: 15
- **Failing**: 12 (80% failure rate)
- **Primary Issue**: Performance timing tests with wrong mock patterns
- **Impact**: Performance validation impossible

**Specific Issues:**

- Race conditions in MSW handler setup
- Timing assumptions based on CLI subprocess overhead
- Mock data not matching REST API response format

### Low Priority Files (Non-blocking)

#### Other test files with <20% failure rates

These files have minimal dependencies on the Azure DevOps client and can be fixed after high-priority files.

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Test Suite Execution Time

**Current**: 16.45 seconds (with 114 failures)
**Target**: <30 seconds (with all tests passing)
**Risk**: Test migration may temporarily increase execution time due to MSW overhead

### WallabyJS Impact

- **Real-time feedback**: Currently showing red across all affected files
- **Runtime values**: Unable to inspect due to early failures
- **Debug capability**: Limited by environment variable failures

## Error Categories & Patterns

### Runtime Errors (30 errors)

**Pattern 1: Immediate Constructor Failures**

```
Error: AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT environment variable is required.

Please create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to https://dev.azure.com/fwcdev/_usersSettings/tokens
2. Create a new token with "Work items (read & write)" permission
3. Set environment variable: export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT="your-token-here"
4. Restart the service
```

**Pattern 2: Mock Resolution Failures**

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'queryWorkItems')
```

**Pattern 3: MSW Handler Race Conditions**

```
Error: Request handler not found for POST https://dev.azure.com/...
```

### Promise Rejection Patterns

Many tests show unhandled promise rejections due to authentication failures in the constructor, before test logic even executes.

## Fix Priority Matrix

### Immediate (Day 1) - 80% Impact

1. **Environment Variable Setup**: Add `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` to all test environments
   - Fixes: 91 out of 114 failures (80%)
   - Time: 30 minutes
   - Risk: Low

### High Priority (Day 1-2) - 15% Impact

2. **Core Mock Strategy Migration**: Update azure-devops.test.ts and integration tests
   - Fixes: 17 out of remaining 23 failures (15%)
   - Time: 4-6 hours
   - Risk: Medium (requires understanding new patterns)

### Medium Priority (Day 2) - 5% Impact

3. **Import Path Resolution**: Fix module resolution and type conflicts
   - Fixes: 6 out of remaining 6 failures (5%)
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Risk: Low

## Recommended Fix Sequence

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (30 minutes)

```bash
# Add to vitest.setup.ts
beforeEach(() => {
  process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT = 'test-token-123'
  process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG = 'fwcdev'
  process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT = 'Customer Services Platform'
})
```

**Expected Result**: 91 tests start passing, failure rate drops to 6.8%

### Phase 2: Mock Migration (4-6 hours)

**File-by-file migration:**

1. azure-devops.test.ts (45 tests) - 2 hours
2. azure-devops-rest-integration.test.ts (16 tests) - 1 hour
3. azure-devops-server.test.ts (25 tests) - 2 hours
4. batch-performance.test.ts (12 tests) - 1 hour

**Expected Result**: All core functionality tests passing

### Phase 3: Cleanup (2 hours)

1. Fix remaining import path issues
2. Update field-discovery tests
3. Verify all 338 tests pass with WallabyJS

**Final Result**: 0% failure rate, 100% test suite health

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Success (Post Phase 1)

- [ ] Test failure rate <10% (currently 33.7%)
- [ ] Environment setup working across all test files
- [ ] WallabyJS showing meaningful results (not just constructor failures)

### Complete Success (Post Phase 3)

- [ ] 0% test failure rate (338/338 passing)
- [ ] Test suite execution time <30 seconds
- [ ] All critical paths covered per DEC-005 requirements
- [ ] WallabyJS providing real-time feedback on all test files

### Quality Gates

- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] All MSW handlers properly configured
- [ ] Mock patterns consistent across test files
- [ ] Data transformation accuracy validated

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- Environment variable setup (standard practice)
- Import path fixes (TypeScript tooling handles resolution)

### Medium Risk

- Mock pattern migration (requires understanding both old and new patterns)
- MSW handler configuration (potential race conditions)
- Data format matching (REST vs CLI response structures)

### High Risk

- Performance test accuracy (timing assumptions may be invalid)
- Integration test complexity (multiple system components)

## Conclusion

The 114 test failures are entirely fixable and represent implementation debt rather than fundamental architectural problems. The fix sequence outlined above should restore the test suite to 100% passing status within 1-2 days of focused effort.

**Key Insight:** The REST API migration was architecturally successful but operationally incomplete due to test migration oversight. Once fixed, the system will be fully production-ready with comprehensive test coverage.
