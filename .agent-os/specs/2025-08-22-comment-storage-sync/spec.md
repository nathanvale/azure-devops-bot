# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Comment Storage Sync
> Created: 2025-08-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement synchronization of all work item comments from Azure DevOps to the local SQLite database, enabling AI agents to access complete conversation history for comprehensive reporting and analysis.

## User Stories

### Complete Comment History Access

As a team lead, I want to access all work item comments locally through the MCP server, so that I can generate comprehensive reports that include discussion context and decision history without waiting for Azure DevOps web pages to load.

When generating sprint reports or analyzing work item progress, I need instant access to all comments that provide context about decisions made, blockers encountered, and resolution approaches discussed by the team.

### Historical Comment Preservation

As a developer, I want all work item comments to be preserved locally, so that historical discussions and decisions remain accessible even if Azure DevOps becomes unavailable or slow.

The local comment history should include all metadata (author, timestamps, modifications) to maintain complete audit trails and enable accurate historical analysis.

## Spec Scope

1. **Comment Fetching** - Retrieve all comments for each work item using Azure CLI
2. **Comment Storage** - Store comments in existing WorkItemComment table with proper relationships
3. **Incremental Sync** - Sync only new/modified comments to optimize performance
4. **Comment Metadata** - Capture author, creation/modification dates, and full comment text
5. **MCP Integration** - Expose comment data through existing and new MCP tools

## Out of Scope

- Comment modification or creation through the MCP server
- Comment attachments or rich formatting preservation
- Real-time comment notifications
- Comment search or indexing beyond basic database queries

## Expected Deliverable

1. Work item comments are automatically synced during regular sync cycles
2. All historical comments are available through MCP tools for AI agent consumption
3. Comment sync performance does not significantly impact overall sync time
