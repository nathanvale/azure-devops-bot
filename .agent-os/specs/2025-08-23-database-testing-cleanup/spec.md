> Spec: Database Testing Cleanup and In-Memory SQLite Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Remove complex database mocking infrastructure and implement a streamlined in-memory SQLite testing strategy to improve test reliability, reduce maintenance overhead, and simplify the codebase architecture.

## User Stories

### Remove Testing Complexity

As a developer, I want to remove the extensive database mocking infrastructure, so that I can focus on building features instead of maintaining complex test mocks that break frequently and provide false confidence.

The current testing setup includes over 1,500 lines of database mocking code across multiple files, with complex Prisma client mocks, MSW handlers, and intricate test utilities. This creates a maintenance burden where tests pass but real database operations might fail in production.

### Enable Reliable Database Testing

As a developer, I want to test against real database operations using in-memory SQLite, so that I can catch actual database-related bugs and ensure my Prisma queries work correctly in production scenarios.

Future testing will use actual SQLite databases that run entirely in memory or as temporary files, providing real database behavior without the complexity of mocking while maintaining fast test execution.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Mock Removal** - Delete all database mocking files and infrastructure
2. **Test File Cleanup** - Remove or refactor tests that rely on database mocks
3. **Documentation Update** - Update testing guidelines to reflect new approach
4. **Vitest Configuration** - Prepare configuration for future in-memory SQLite testing
5. **Migration Path** - Establish clear path for implementing real database tests

## Out of Scope

- Implementing the actual in-memory SQLite testing (future phase)
- Rewriting existing business logic or database schemas
- Adding new test coverage beyond what currently exists
- Performance optimization of existing code

## Expected Deliverable

1. Codebase with all database mocking infrastructure removed
2. Simplified test structure focused on unit tests for business logic
3. Clear documentation for future in-memory SQLite implementation
4. Reduced test complexity with no false-positive passing tests
