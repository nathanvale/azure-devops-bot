> Spec: Fix MCP Server Sync Blocking Issue
> Created: 2025-08-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the MCP server startup issue where the server becomes unresponsive during the initial detailed sync process, preventing AI agents from accessing the successfully stored Azure DevOps work item data that already exists in the local SQLite database.

## User Stories

### AI Agent Access to Work Item Data

As an AI agent trying to access Azure DevOps work item data, I want to receive immediate responses from the MCP server, so that I can generate reports and provide insights without waiting for lengthy sync processes to complete.

**Detailed Workflow**: When an AI agent sends a request to the MCP server for work item data, the server should immediately serve data from the local SQLite database (which contains 1,056 work items with 159 relevant to configured users) rather than blocking on Azure DevOps API calls that may fail due to rate limiting or authentication issues.

### Developer Experience 

As a developer using the Azure DevOps Bot, I want the MCP server to start quickly and be immediately available for queries, so that I can get instant access to my work item data without debugging sync issues.

**Detailed Workflow**: When starting the MCP server via `pnpm mcp --emails=user@domain.com`, the server should start within 5 seconds and immediately respond to MCP tool calls like `wit_my_work_items`, serving cached data while performing background sync operations separately.

### System Reliability

As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to be resilient to Azure DevOps API failures, so that local data access remains available even when the remote service has issues.

**Detailed Workflow**: The server should detect when detailed sync operations are failing (circuit breaker activation) and gracefully degrade to serving cached data while logging sync issues for later investigation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Non-Blocking Server Startup** - MCP server starts immediately and serves existing cached data
2. **Background Sync Separation** - Move initial detailed sync to a background process that doesn't block MCP requests  
3. **Graceful Sync Failure Handling** - Continue serving cached data when Azure DevOps sync fails
4. **Fast Response Path** - Ensure MCP tool calls return within 100ms using cached SQLite data
5. **Sync Status Reporting** - Add optional MCP tool to report background sync status

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the database schema or data structure
- Changing the Azure DevOps integration approach  
- Adding new MCP tools beyond sync status reporting
- Performance optimizations beyond the blocking issue

## Expected Deliverable

1. **MCP server starts within 5 seconds** and immediately responds to tool calls
2. **All existing MCP tools work instantly** using cached SQLite data
3. **Background sync runs independently** without blocking MCP responses
4. **Graceful handling** of Azure DevOps API failures during background sync
